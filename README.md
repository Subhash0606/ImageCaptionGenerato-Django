![Vision Encoder Decoder](/static/vision-encoder-decoder.png)


Overview
Image to Caption is a Django web app that leverages the OpenAI Language Model (LLM) and Vision Transformers to generate captions for a wide variety of images. This project aims to provide users with an easy and interactive way to add descriptive captions to their images using state-of-the-art language and vision models.

**Getting Started**
To use this app, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:  
git clone https://github.com/example/repository.git

Install the required dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt

Set up your Python environment (requires Python >= 3.7):
virtualenv -p path_to_installedPY3.7.exe Py37env
Run the Django website:

python manage.py runserver

**Limitations**
The caption generation is dependent on the capabilities of the OpenAI Language Model and Vision Transformers. The accuracy and quality of the generated captions rely on the precision of the language model and the effectiveness of the code embeddings.
