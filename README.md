Overview
Image to Caption is a Django web app that leverages the OpenAI Language Model (LLM) and Vision Transformers to generate captions for a wide variety of images. This project aims to provide users with an easy and interactive way to add descriptive captions to their images using state-of-the-art language and vision models.

Getting Started
To use this app, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/example/repository.git
Install the required dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Set up your Python environment (requires Python >= 3.7):

bash
Copy code
virtualenv -p path_to_installedPY3.7.exe Py37env
Run the Django website:

bash
Copy code
python manage.py runserver
Limitations
The caption generation is dependent on the capabilities of the OpenAI Language Model and Vision Transformers. The accuracy and quality of the generated captions rely on the precision of the language model and the effectiveness of the code embeddings.

How to put image in readme.md
ChatGPT
To include an image in your readme.md file, you can use the following Markdown syntax:

markdown
Copy code
![Alt Text](url_or_relative_path_to_image)
Replace "Alt Text" with a descriptive alternative text for your image, and replace "url_or_relative_path_to_image" with the actual URL or relative path to your image file.

Here's an example using your project's image:

markdown
Copy code
![Vision Encoder Decoder](vision-encoder-decoder.png)
Make sure the image file (vision-encoder-decoder.png in this case) is in the same directory as your readme.md file or provide the correct relative path if it's in a different directory.

If your image is hosted online, you can provide the URL directly:

markdown
Copy code
![Vision Encoder Decoder](https://example.com/path/to/vision-encoder-decoder.png)
Remember to replace the example URL with the actual URL of your image.
